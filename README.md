# Hi, I'm Jack Schneider

I'm an early-career engineer determined to have a high-impact career. The pursuit of this vision has led me data science/AI. I graduated from UMass Amherst with a degree in Computer Engineering and am currently a student/employee, working toward a career in NYC's tech scene.

I'm pursuing my master's degree in the Engineering of Artificial Intelligence at Stony Brook University. My studies have given me experience in machine learning, data engineering, and software engineering. I'm also a technician at RCE Manufacturing where my background and personality have made me a unique, curious, and collaborative coworker/employee.

My current goals are to land a full time role in NYC and to continue to grow my knowledge and professional skills. I'm open to any oppurtunity to grow whether it is a project, start-up, referall, or just a call.
